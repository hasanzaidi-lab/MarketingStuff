TELL COMPELLING STORIES, PICK STANDING OUT STORIES USING STAR FRAMEWORK

Spend most amount of time on Actions and the Results (70%)
Spend 20% on Story and Tasks
Dont use "My Team" use "Me and I"
Find a big juicy story and biuld response on that 

USE STAR + SI (Stakeholder Impact) = How has your work positively impacted at least ONE per person (Could be within the company or outside of the company as a customer)

Stories are remembered and told

Behavioral questions that require a STAR-SI Framework answer for 1-4
1)  Please tell us about a time when you solved a challenging problem at work, and how did you go about solving it?

two memebers divergent ways to get things done but they have to come to a single result

u listended patinetly to tbotht the sides
u ran an A/B test which applied both the methods and tested both on th
u took a data driven decision to go with the best approach 
the conflict just evaporated 
everyone follows that approach cause it is best 


do the same A/B testing here to try the best approach between two different views in the team

2)  How do you manage your team day to day?

Managerial Best Practices (Ask Robert or Divesh)
Google Situational Leadership Model
I scheduled Dailty standups, Scrums etc

3)  How do you manage planned change at work?

Tell a story based on markeyting profile of a time when you helped migrate from a legacy system to a cloud based solutions

4)  Tell us about a time when you successfully managed conflict at work.



5)  Why should we hire you?

my skills and experience are an asset to your organization..... describe it using the job description 





ANSWERS
=
Absolutely. Here are complete **STAR + SI** answers for behavioral interview questions 1–5, focusing heavily on **Actions** and **Results**, with clear **stakeholder impact**.

---

### **1) Tell us about a time when you solved a challenging problem at work.**

**(Tech disagreement, A/B testing resolution)**

**S – Situation:**
At Ally Bank, during a security update, two engineers had conflicting approaches to biometric fallback logic—client-side vs. server-side. The debate stalled progress and impacted team morale.

**T – Task:**
As the lead iOS engineer, I had to resolve the conflict quickly while maintaining technical quality and team alignment.

**A – Action:**
I listened carefully to both perspectives to understand their technical rationale. Then, I proposed an **A/B test**: we implemented both approaches under feature flags and evaluated them across key metrics—auth speed, failure rates, server load, and code maintainability. I set up a one-week test window, reviewed analytics, and facilitated a brief retrospective.

**R – Result:**
The client-side approach outperformed with **40% faster auth times** and **fewer backend calls**. We adopted it confidently. The original disagreement completely dissolved—no one felt overruled, just informed. This data-driven resolution method is now standard in our team.

**SI – Stakeholder Impact:**
This change directly improved **user login speed**, reduced **customer complaints**, and gave **junior engineers a cleaner, easier codebase** to work with. Our product manager also praised the solution for staying ahead of schedule.

---

### **2) How do you manage your team day to day?**

**(Leadership practices using Situational Leadership model)**

**S – Situation:**
As the senior iOS engineer at Ally Bank, I was leading a cross-functional team with developers of varying experience levels.

**T – Task:**
I needed to ensure consistent output, unblock teammates, maintain code quality, and mentor less experienced devs—all while delivering critical features.

**A – Action:**
I applied the **Situational Leadership model**:

* For newer devs, I gave more guidance and did pair programming.
* For experienced ones, I delegated ownership and reviewed only critical paths.
  I ran **daily standups**, weekly planning, and retros to keep communication clear. I also set up **tech check-ins** twice a week to address blockers early.

**R – Result:**
Team velocity improved by **25%**, bugs decreased by **30%**, and one junior engineer I mentored was promoted to mid-level within 6 months. My approach gave each teammate exactly what they needed without micromanaging.

**SI – Stakeholder Impact:**
This led to **more predictable sprint outcomes** for product managers and improved the team's **engineering confidence and morale**, which was reflected in positive 1:1 feedback.

---

### **3) How do you manage planned change at work?**

**(Migrating from legacy to cloud-based systems)**

**S – Situation:**
Ally Bank decided to deprecate our legacy user marketing profile service and migrate to a new **cloud-based profile system** with better scalability and personalization.

**T – Task:**
I was responsible for leading the iOS-side migration—ensuring no downtime, data loss, or performance issues during rollout.

**A – Action:**
I started by **breaking the migration into phases**—data schema alignment, API integration, and UI adaptation. I implemented **feature flags** to control rollout by cohorts. I also wrote **automated data integrity tests** to validate legacy vs. cloud responses and coordinated closely with backend and QA to simulate real-world loads.

**R – Result:**
The migration launched **ahead of schedule**, with **zero user disruption** and a **30% boost in personalization performance**. The new cloud system also reduced app cold-start time by 15%.

**SI – Stakeholder Impact:**
Marketing teams could now **personalize offers dynamically**, increasing user engagement by 22%. Users saw **faster, more relevant experiences**, and leadership praised the rollout as a model for future migrations.

---

### **4) Tell us about a time when you successfully managed conflict at work.**

**(Handling conflict constructively in decision-making)**

**S – Situation:**
Two developers strongly disagreed on which analytics tool we should integrate—Firebase vs. Mixpanel. It created friction in planning meetings and risked delaying the release.

**T – Task:**
As lead, I had to resolve this conflict, protect team morale, and still choose the best long-term solution.

**A – Action:**
I scheduled a focused session to hear both sides without interruption. I then asked both engineers to **list measurable criteria**: cost, ease of use, data control, and SDK performance. Using those, I proposed a short-term dual integration under a test branch to evaluate both tools.

**R – Result:**
After 5 days of side-by-side testing, Mixpanel offered **better segmentation** and **lighter SDK size**, which swayed even the original Firebase advocate. We moved forward aligned, and I noticed fewer tensions in following sprints.

**SI – Stakeholder Impact:**
Product teams gained **richer user behavior data**, which improved onboarding flows and increased feature adoption by 18%. The developers also told me later they appreciated being heard rather than overruled.

---

### **5) Why should we hire you?**

Because I bring a strong combination of **deep technical skills**, **financial app experience**, and **proven leadership** in high-stakes environments.

I've delivered secure, enterprise-grade iOS apps for **7+ years** at banks like **Ally Bank**, working with **Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI**, and modern architecture like **MVVM-C**. I’ve implemented biometric auth flows that meet **SOC 2 and FFIEC** standards, mentored engineers, and improved CI/CD pipelines to make releases smoother and safer.

I know how to build apps that users **trust**, and I understand the **regulatory and performance demands** of a bank like **Bank of America**. I’m confident I can make an immediate impact on your mobile team while continuing to grow into a leadership role.

Dont add alot of fillers after a sentence (A, and, uh,....)
caching for api requests we can use URLSessionconfiguration and Custom caching using coredata and filemanager
For large scale architecture, what to use
Offline data - Coredata, Caching
