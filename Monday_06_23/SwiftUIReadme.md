# ðŸ§© SwiftUI Fundamentals

### 1. What Is SwiftUI?

SwiftUI is Appleâ€™s modern declarative UI framework introduced in iOS 13. It allows developers to design and manage UI using Swift code. Unlike UIKit, which requires imperative programming, SwiftUI describes the UI as a function of its state.

**Example:**

```swift
struct WelcomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Welcome to SwiftUI!")
            .padding()
            .font(.title)
    }
}
```

### 2. Different Kinds of Bindings in SwiftUI

* `@State`: Stores local, view-owned state. Automatically triggers UI updates.

  ```swift
  @State private var counter = 0
  ```

* `@Binding`: Allows child view to mutate a `@State` from a parent.

  ```swift
  struct ChildView: View {
    @Binding var isOn: Bool
    var body: some View { Toggle("Enabled", isOn: $isOn) }
  }
  ```

* `@ObservedObject`: Watches an external object conforming to `ObservableObject`. Used for shared logic across views.

  ```swift
  class TimerModel: ObservableObject {
      @Published var seconds = 0
  }
  struct TimerView: View {
      @ObservedObject var model: TimerModel
  }
  ```

* `@StateObject`: Same as `@ObservedObject`, but the view owns and initializes the object.

  ```swift
  @StateObject var model = TimerModel()
  ```

* `@EnvironmentObject`: Injected object that is shared app-wide.

  ```swift
  struct ProfileView: View {
      @EnvironmentObject var userSettings: UserSettings
  }
  ```

### 3. `@State` vs `@ObservedObject` vs `@StateObject` vs `@EnvironmentObject`

| Property Wrapper     | Ownership         | Scope              | Use Case                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `@State`             | View owns         | Local view only    | Counter, toggles, UI states               |
| `@ObservedObject`    | External object   | Passed from parent | Shared model, reused logic                |
| `@StateObject`       | View creates/owns | New in iOS 14+     | View instantiates its own model           |
| `@EnvironmentObject` | Global injection  | Across many views  | App-wide shared data (e.g. user settings) |

### 4. What Is GeometryReader?

A layout tool that provides access to container viewâ€™s size and coordinates.

**Use Case:** Build responsive designs.

```swift
GeometryReader { geometry in
  Text("Width: \(geometry.size.width)")
    .frame(width: geometry.size.width / 2)
}
```

### 5. What Are View Modifiers?

They are chainable functions that modify viewsâ€™ appearance and behavior.

```swift
Text("Styled")
  .foregroundColor(.white)
  .background(Color.blue)
  .font(.headline)
  .padding()
```

### 6. What Are View Builders?

Closures that return views. Used in layout containers and declarative syntax.

```swift
VStack {
  Text("Line 1")
  Text("Line 2")
}
```

They power DSL-like syntax in SwiftUI.

### 7. Challenges Faced in SwiftUI

* **Debugging**: Hard to trace issues due to unclear error logs.
* **Layout Issues**: Misalignment due to `Spacer`/frame conflicts.
* **Navigation**: Complex for deep links and programmatic flows.
* **iOS version support**: Some APIs are only available in newer versions.

### 8. Difference Between UIKit and SwiftUI

| Feature         | UIKit               | SwiftUI                |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Paradigm        | Imperative          | Declarative            |
| Code Complexity | Verbose             | Concise                |
| Preview         | Manual              | Live Preview (Canvas)  |
| Compatibility   | Mature, flexible    | Still maturing         |
| Animations      | Manual              | Automatic, declarative |
| Testing         | UI Tests (XCUITest) | Preview + UI Tests     |

### 9. How to Use SwiftUI in UIKit

Wrap SwiftUI in `UIHostingController`:

```swift
let vc = UIHostingController(rootView: ContentView())
self.present(vc, animated: true)
```

### 10. How to Use UIKit in SwiftUI

Use `UIViewRepresentable` to wrap UIKit views:

```swift
struct UIKitLabel: UIViewRepresentable {
  func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UILabel {
    let label = UILabel()
    label.text = "UIKit Label"
    return label
  }
  func updateUIView(_ uiView: UILabel, context: Context) {}
}
```
