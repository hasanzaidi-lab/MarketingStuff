Hi, I’m Hasan Zaidi — a Senior iOS Engineer with over 7 years of experience building secure, high-performance mobile apps, primarily in the financial sector.

Throughout my career, I’ve delivered enterprise-grade solutions for major banks and financial institutions, including Truist Bank and Capital One. I’ve consistently focused on building scalable, secure, and user-friendly apps that handle sensitive financial data with care and compliance.

My core expertise includes Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI, MVVM-C, and Combine. I also work extensively with Core Data, Keychain, biometric authentication, RESTful APIs, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure fast, reliable releases.

Most recently at Truist, I led the implementation of secure authentication flows that met SOC 2 and FFIEC standards, improved production stability, mentored junior engineers, and contributed to key infrastructure improvements.

I’m passionate about creating trusted mobile experiences—especially in fintech, where security and usability are equally critical. As I wrap up my current project, I’m looking forward to new challenges and am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Bank of America’s mobile team.

Hi, I’m Hasan Zaidi. I’ve been building iOS apps for over 10 years now—mostly in fintech—and I’ve really come to enjoy working on complex, secure, and user-friendly mobile experiences.

Most of my time has been spent at places like **Truist Bank** and **Capital One**, where I helped build apps that handle sensitive financial data. I’ve led efforts around secure authentication, biometric login, and building out modular, testable features using **Swift**, **MVVM-C**, and **Combine**.

At Truist, one of my favorite projects was leading a major security upgrade—we built a new auth flow that met **SOC 2** and **FFIEC** standards. I also helped stabilize our CI/CD pipelines, mentored a few junior devs, and worked closely with product and security teams to make sure we shipped fast without compromising quality.

What drives me most is building things people trust. In fintech, you only get one chance to earn user confidence, and I enjoy solving the hard problems that make that possible—things like login reliability, secure data handling, and making flows feel seamless.

Now that my current project’s wrapping up, I’m excited for what’s next. I’d love to bring what I’ve learned to the **Bank of America** team and keep building secure, scalable apps that users can rely on. I have a strong feeling that I will be an
