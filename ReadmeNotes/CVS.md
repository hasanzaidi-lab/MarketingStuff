# ✅ Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Detailed Notes

---

![TDD Cycle](https://www.zealousys.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Steps-to-Implementing-Test-Driven-Development.png)

---

## 🚦 What is TDD?

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development methodology where you write automated tests *before* writing the actual code. It ensures code correctness, better design, and faster debugging through a short, repeatable cycle.

---

## 🔁 The TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)

### 🔴 1. Red Phase – *Write a Failing Test*

* Define a test for a new feature or behavior.
* The test fails initially because the feature isn't implemented.
* This failure validates that the test is correctly detecting the missing behavior.

```swift
func testSumOfTwoNumbers() {
    let result = Calculator.add(2, 3)
    XCTAssertEqual(result, 5) // Fails initially
}
```

---

### 🟢 2. Green Phase – *Write Minimal Code to Pass the Test*

* Write the **simplest** code to make the test pass.
* Do not worry about optimization or cleanliness yet.

```swift
class Calculator {
    static func add(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
        return a + b
    }
}
```

---

### 🟡 3. Refactor Phase – *Improve Without Breaking*

* Clean up code:

  * Remove duplication
  * Improve naming
  * Enhance structure
* Ensure all tests still pass.

---

## ✅ Benefits of TDD

### 📈 Improved Code Quality

* Encourages modular, testable, and clean code.

### 🐞 Early Bug Detection

* Tests catch issues before implementation even starts.

### ⏱ Reduced Debugging Time

* Pinpoints failing features immediately.

### 🧠 Better Code Design

* Leads to thoughtful, usage-focused interfaces and architecture.

### 🔒 Increased Confidence in Changes

* A strong test suite means safer refactoring and easier feature updates.

### 👥 Enhanced Collaboration

* Tests act as documentation and clarify expected behaviors.

### 🔁 Continuous Feedback

* The Red-Green-Refactor cycle quickly surfaces regressions and mistakes.

---

## 🧪 Best Practices

* Keep test cases **focused and independent**.
* Stick to small, incremental changes.
* Avoid over-engineering in the Green phase.
* Emphasize **behavioral testing**, not implementation details.
* Use mocking/stubbing for dependencies.

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall                              | Why It’s Bad                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Writing too many tests at once       | Breaks focus and slows down feedback      |
| Ignoring failing tests               | Undermines test trust                     |
| Testing implementation, not behavior | Leads to fragile and hard-to-change tests |
| Skipping refactor phase              | Results in messy, unmaintainable code     |

---

## 🧠 Example Flow

> Feature: Add support for subtraction

1. **Red:**

```swift
func testSubtraction() {
    let result = Calculator.subtract(5, 3)
    XCTAssertEqual(result, 2) // Fails
}
```

2. **Green:**

```swift
static func subtract(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
    return a - b
}
```

3. **Refactor:** (If necessary, e.g., move to protocol or reuse logic)

---

## 🔄 TDD vs Traditional Development

| Aspect       | TDD                       | Traditional                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Test Timing  | Before code               | After code                    |
| Design Focus | Behavior-driven           | Implementation-driven         |
| Debugging    | Early and quick           | Later and costlier            |
| Confidence   | High due to test coverage | Lower, often missing coverage |

---

## 🧪 TDD in iOS (Swift)

* Use `XCTest` for unit testing.
* Combine with `Quick` & `Nimble` for BDD-style syntax.
* Leverage mocks for external dependencies (e.g., `URLSession`, databases).
* Works well with CI tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Bitrise.

---

## 📘 Related Concepts

* **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)** – Similar, but focuses on business-readable scenarios.
* **Unit Testing** – Core part of TDD, focused on testing logic in isolation.
* **CI/CD** – TDD fits naturally into Continuous Integration pipelines.

## ✅ Combined Pitch: Telemetry, Observability & TDD

> **"I have hands-on experience implementing telemetry and observability pipelines beyond Firebase, using tools like Sentry, DataDog, OSLog, and MetricKit to monitor app health, detect performance regressions, and track user behavior. I strongly believe in building testability into the architecture from the start, and I've successfully applied TDD practices using XCTest and XCUITest frameworks to ensure high-quality, predictable code in production."**

---

## 🔍 Telemetry & Observability — Beyond Firebase

### Tools Used:

* **Sentry / Crashlytics** – for crash/error logging and context-aware stack traces.
* **DataDog** – integrated mobile RUM SDK for:

  * Real-time monitoring of user sessions
  * Performance metrics (app start time, ANRs, battery usage)
  * Custom event tracking (network retries, API errors)
* **MetricKit** – leveraged native iOS diagnostics for CPU, memory, hangs, and battery drain insights.
* **OSLog / Unified Logging** – added structured, filterable logs across critical paths, with privacy protection.
* **Custom Analytics Pipelines** – pushed structured events to backend ingestion services (via REST or Kafka).

### Real Impact:

* Proactively reduced crash rate by 40% after identifying rare thread-lock issues via Sentry traces.
* Detected and resolved 5-second cold starts via MetricKit cold launch reports.
* Reduced app hangs using unified logging to trace problematic rendering logic.

---

## ✅ Test-Driven Development (TDD) Experience

### TDD Practices:

* Wrote **failing tests first** using XCTest, then implemented code to make tests pass (true TDD cycle).
* Isolated business logic in ViewModels or Interactors for easy unit testing.
* Used **dependency injection** to mock services and API layers.
* Automated **UI tests** with XCUITest and **snapshot testing** for SwiftUI components.

### Example Results:

* Maintained **>85% unit test coverage** in mission-critical modules.
* Prevented regressions in a multi-threaded API caching layer using concurrent unit test cases.
* Caught layout issues early using visual diff tests for SwiftUI views.

---

## 🧠 Interview One-Liner

> “I approach observability as a development responsibility, not just ops — using tools like Sentry, DataDog, and MetricKit to close the feedback loop on app health. Combined with a strong TDD mindset, I ensure that every feature is built with testability and traceability from day one.”

---


Absolutely — here are **specific code examples** for both:

---

## ✅ 1. **Custom `OSLog` Setup (Unified Logging)**

### 💡 Purpose:

Send structured, privacy-aware logs into the unified logging system (Console app in macOS).

### 🧱 Setup

```swift
import os

struct AppLogger {
    static let network = Logger(subsystem: Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier ?? "com.myapp", category: "network")
    static let ui = Logger(subsystem: Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier ?? "com.myapp", category: "ui")
    static let core = Logger(subsystem: Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier ?? "com.myapp", category: "core")
}
```

### 🔍 Usage

```swift
AppLogger.network.info("📡 Sending request to: \(url, privacy: .public)")
AppLogger.network.debug("Headers: \(headers, privacy: .private)")
AppLogger.core.error("❌ Failed to decode JSON: \(error.localizedDescription, privacy: .public)")
AppLogger.ui.log(level: .default, "User tapped on button")
```

> ✅ **Best practices:**

* Use `.public` for non-sensitive info, `.private` for user data.
* Use `Logger` (new in iOS 14+) over `os_log` (deprecated).

---

## ✅ 2. **TDD Example in Swift: ViewModel Test**

### 🎯 Goal: Test `LoginViewModel` logic using TDD

### 🧪 Step 1: Write a failing test

```swift
import XCTest
@testable import MyApp

final class LoginViewModelTests: XCTestCase {
    func testLoginSuccessEmitsUserName() {
        // Arrange
        let mockService = MockAuthService()
        mockService.stubbedLoginResult = .success(User(name: "Hasan"))
        let viewModel = LoginViewModel(authService: mockService)

        // Act
        viewModel.login(email: "test@example.com", password: "password123")

        // Assert
        XCTAssertEqual(viewModel.userName, "Hasan")
    }
}
```

---

### ⚙️ Step 2: Implement minimal code to pass

```swift
class LoginViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var userName: String = ""
    private let authService: AuthServicing

    init(authService: AuthServicing) {
        self.authService = authService
    }

    func login(email: String, password: String) {
        authService.login(email: email, password: password) { result in
            if case let .success(user) = result {
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self.userName = user.name
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🔧 Mock Auth Service

```swift
protocol AuthServicing {
    func login(email: String, password: String, completion: @escaping (Result<User, Error>) -> Void)
}

struct User {
    let name: String
}

class MockAuthService: AuthServicing {
    var stubbedLoginResult: Result<User, Error>?

    func login(email: String, password: String, completion: @escaping (Result<User, Error>) -> Void) {
        if let result = stubbedLoginResult {
            completion(result)
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tips

* Use `XCTestExpectation` if login is async.
* Use `ViewInspector` to test SwiftUI views (`https://github.com/nalexn/ViewInspector`).
* Use dependency injection to keep tests clean and isolated.

As a **Lead iOS Engineer**, you're expected to go beyond coding — you **set the standards**, **guide the team**, and **ensure delivery at scale**. Below are **iOS best practices** divided into technical, architectural, testing, performance, and leadership categories — curated specifically for someone in a leadership role like yours:

---

## ✅ 1. **Architecture & Code Structure**

### 📌 Best Practices:

* Choose architecture wisely: **MVVM** or **VIPER** for modularity, testability
* Follow **SOLID**, **DRY**, and **KISS** principles
* Modularize code into **frameworks** or **Swift Packages**
* Use **protocol-oriented programming** over inheritance
* Abstract networking and persistence layers
* Avoid massive `ViewController` / `View`

### 🧠 Lead Advice:

* Own architectural decisions, keep documentation up to date
* Set code conventions through linters and sample modules

---

## ✅ 2. **Swift + SwiftUI Best Practices**

### 📌 Swift:

* Favor `struct` over `class` unless reference semantics are needed
* Use `enum` for finite states and typed errors
* Prefer `final` where subclassing is not intended
* Make use of **property wrappers** properly (`@State`, `@Binding`, etc.)
* Avoid force unwraps `!` — always handle optionals safely

### 📌 SwiftUI:

* Use `@StateObject` for owned models, `@ObservedObject` for passed-in
* Split UI into small reusable views
* Use `PreferenceKey` and `GeometryReader` sparingly — only when necessary
* Always support **Dark Mode** and **Dynamic Type**

---

## ✅ 3. **Networking & Data Layer**

### 📌 Best Practices:

* Use `URLSession` or `Alamofire` with proper abstraction
* Decode API responses using `Codable` with custom error handling
* Handle retries, timeouts, and caching via `URLCache` or `NSCache`
* Use `Combine` or `async/await` to model reactive flows

### 🧠 Lead Advice:

* Create testable, environment-switchable API clients
* Define a clear error model for unified user messaging

---

## ✅ 4. **Testing & CI/CD**

### 📌 Best Practices:

* Follow **TDD** where feasible (start with test)
* Use **XCTest** and **XCUITest** for unit + UI testing
* Snapshot test SwiftUI components
* Mock dependencies with protocols

### 🧠 Lead Advice:

* Define custom event taxonomy with Product/Design
* Instrument key flows with logging + analytics for visibility

---

## ✅ 6. **Security & Privacy**

### 📌 Best Practices:

* Store sensitive info in **Keychain**, never `UserDefaults`
* Use **Sign in with Apple** or OAuth flows
* Mask PII in logs
* Use **App Transport Security (ATS)**

---

## ✅ 7. **Performance Optimization**

### 📌 Best Practices:

* Use Instruments to catch memory leaks, slow views
* Avoid blocking main thread (offload JSON parsing, image decoding)
* Use lazy views/data loading
* Optimize SwiftUI views with `.drawingGroup`, `@ViewBuilder`, etc.

---

## ✅ 8. **User Experience & Accessibility**

### 📌 Best Practices:

* Use `AccessibilityIdentifier` for UI tests and accessibility support
* Respect Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, and reduced motion settings
* Support localization/internationalization from the start

---

## ✅ 9. **Team & Process Leadership**
